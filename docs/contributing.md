# Contributing

Welcome to `delta-e` contributor's guide.

This document focuses on getting any potential contributor familiarized
with the development processes, but [other kinds of contributions] are also
appreciated.

If you are new to using [git] or have never collaborated in a project previously,
please have a look at [contribution-guide.org]. Other resources are also
listed in the excellent [guide created by FreeCodeCamp] [^contrib1].

Please notice, all users and contributors are expected to be **open,
considerate, reasonable, and respectful**. When in doubt, [Python Software
Foundation's Code of Conduct][python software foundation's code of conduct] is a good reference in terms of behavior
guidelines.

## Issue Reports

If you experience bugs or general issues with `delta-e`, please have a look
on the [issue tracker]. If you don't see anything useful there, please feel
free to fire an issue report.

:::{tip}
Please don't forget to include the closed issues in your search.
Sometimes a solution was already reported, and the problem is considered
**solved**.
:::

New issue reports should include information about your programming environment
(e.g., operating system, Python version) and steps to reproduce the problem.
Please try also to simplify the reproduction steps to a very minimal example
that still illustrates the problem you are facing. By removing other factors,
you help us to identify the root cause of the issue.

## Documentation Improvements

If you would like to contribute to improving the documentation, we welcome your help! Clear and comprehensive documentation is crucial for the success of any project, and your contributions can make a significant impact. Here are a few ways you can contribute:

### Submit an issue

Before you work on any non-trivial code contribution it's best to first create
a report in the [issue tracker] to start a discussion on the subject.
This often provides additional considerations and avoids unnecessary work.

### Making Documentation Readable and Coherent

One way to contribute is by improving the readability and coherence of the existing documentation. This involves rephrasing sentences, organizing content, and ensuring consistent formatting. By enhancing the clarity of the documentation, you can make it more accessible to users.

### Adding Missing Information and Correcting Mistakes

If you come across any gaps in the documentation or spot errors, you can contribute by adding missing information and correcting mistakes. This includes updating outdated examples, clarifying confusing sections, and addressing any inaccuracies you may find.

### Making Changes to the Actual Documentation

`delta-e` documentation uses [Sphinx] as its main documentation compiler.
This means that the docs are kept in the same repository as the project code, and
that any documentation update is done in the same way was a code contribution. **\_(Refer below to the Code Contributions section for more deatils)**

:::{tip}
Please notice that the [GitHub web interface] provides a quick way of
propose changes in `delta-e`'s files. While this mechanism can
be tricky for normal code contributions, it works perfectly fine for
contributing to the docs, and can be quite handy.

If you are interested in trying this method out, please navigate to
the `docs` folder in the source [repository], find which file you
would like to propose changes and click in the little pencil icon at the
top, to open [GitHub's code editor]. Once you finish editing the file,
please write a message in the form at the bottom of the page describing
which changes have you made and what are the motivations behind them and
submit your proposal.
:::

When working on documentation changes in your local machine, you can
compile them using [tox]:

```
tox -e docs
```

and use Python's built-in web server for a preview in your web browser
(`http://localhost:8000`):

```
python3 -m http.server --directory 'docs/_build/html'
```

## Code Contributions

### Submit an issue

Before you work on any non-trivial code contribution it's best to first create
a report in the [issue tracker] to start a discussion on the subject.
This often provides additional considerations and avoids unnecessary work.

### Create an environment

Before you start coding, we recommend creating an isolated [virtual
environment][virtual environment] to avoid any problems with your installed Python packages.
This can easily be done via either [virtualenv]:

```
virtualenv <PATH TO VENV>
source <PATH TO VENV>/bin/activate
```

or [Miniconda]:

```
conda create -n delta-e python=3 six virtualenv pytest pytest-cov
conda activate delta-e
```

### Clone the repository

1. Create an user account on GitHub if you do not already have one.

2. Fork the project [repository]: click on the _Fork_ button near the top of the
   page. This creates a copy of the code under your account on GitHub.

3. Clone this copy to your local disk:

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/delta-e.git
   cd delta-e
   ```

4. You should run:

   ```
   pip install -U pip setuptools -e .
   ```

   to be able to import the package under development in the Python REPL.

### Implement your changes

1. Create a branch to hold your changes:

   ```
   git checkout -b my-feature
   ```

   and start making changes. Never work on the main branch!

2. Start your work on this branch. Don't forget to add [docstrings] to new
   functions, modules and classes, especially if they are part of public APIs.

3. Add yourself to the list of contributors in `AUTHORS.rst`.

4. When youâ€™re done editing, do:

   ```
   git add <MODIFIED FILES>
   git commit
   ```

   to record your changes in [git].

   :::{important}
   Don't forget to add unit tests and documentation in case your
   contribution adds an additional feature and is not just a bugfix.

   Moreover, writing a [descriptive commit message] is highly recommended.
   In case of doubt, you can check the commit history with:

   ```
   git log --graph --decorate --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit --all
   ```

   to look for recurring communication patterns.
   :::

5. Please check that your changes don't break any unit tests with:

   ```
   tox
   ```

   (after having installed [tox] with `pip install tox` or `pipx`).

   You can also use [tox] to run several other pre-configured tasks in the
   repository. Try `tox -av` to see a list of the available checks.

### Submit your contribution

1. If everything works fine, push your local branch to GitHub with:

   ```
   git push -u origin my-feature
   ```

2. Go to the web page of your fork and click the "Create pull request"
   to send your changes for review.

   :::{note}
   if you are using GitHub, you can uncomment the following paragraph

   Find more detailed information in [creating a PR]. You might also want to open
   the PR as a draft first and mark it as ready for review after the feedbacks
   from the continuous integration (CI) system or any required fixes.

## Maintainer tasks

### Releases

If you are part of the group of maintainers, the following steps can be used to release a new version for
`delta-e`:

1. Ensure that all unit tests pass successfully and that the new release tag has been added within the code.
2. Tag the current commit on the main branch with a release tag, such as `v1.2.3`.
3. Push the new tag to the upstream [repository], e.g., `git push upstream v1.2.3`
4. Clean up the dist and build folders to avoid confusion with previous builds and Sphinx docs.
   You can use `tox -e clean` or manually remove the folders with `rm -rf dist build`.
5. Run `tox -e build` and check that the files in `dist` have
   the correct version (no `.dirty` or [git] hash) according to the [git] tag.
   Also check the sizes of the distributions, if they are too big (e.g., >
   500KB), unwanted clutter may have been accidentally included.
6. Execute the command `pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --name=app form.py` to create the new version of the app.

## Troubleshooting

The following tips can be used when facing problems to build or test the
package:

1. Try using `python -m tox -e docs` if `tox -e docs`. In a similar vein add `python -m tox [anything]` if `tox` command doesn't work.

2. Make sure to fetch all the tags from the upstream [repository].
   The command `git describe --abbrev=0 --tags` should return the version you
   are expecting. If you are trying to run CI scripts in a fork repository,
   make sure to push all the tags.
   You can also try to remove all the egg files or the complete egg folder, i.e.,
   `.eggs`, as well as the `*.egg-info` folders in the `src` folder or
   potentially in the root of your project.

3. Sometimes [tox] misses out when new dependencies are added, especially to
   `setup.cfg` and `docs/requirements.txt`. If you find any problems with
   missing dependencies when running a command with [tox], try to recreate the
   `tox` environment using the `-r` flag. For example, instead of:

   ```
   tox -e docs
   ```

   Try running:

   ```
   tox -r -e docs
   ```

4. Make sure to have a reliable [tox] installation that uses the correct
   Python version (e.g., 3.7+). When in doubt you can run:

   ```
   tox --version
   # OR
   which tox
   ```

   If you have trouble and are seeing weird errors upon running [tox], you can
   also try to create a dedicated [virtual environment] with a [tox] binary
   freshly installed. For example:

   ```
   virtualenv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   .venv/bin/pip install tox
   .venv/bin/tox -e all
   ```

5. [Pytest can drop you] in an interactive session in the case an error occurs.
   In order to do that you need to pass a `--pdb` option (for example by
   running `tox -- -k <NAME OF THE FALLING TEST> --pdb`).
   You can also setup breakpoints manually instead of using the `--pdb` option.
