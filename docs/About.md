# **0. About me**

Hi! Welcome to Read the Docs!

This repository was created in order to facilitate the research projects of Delta E+ members. The Read the docs is intended to be used to search through previously used datasets in Delta E+ projects, so that any researcher working on similar topics would have an easier time looking for useful datasets.

Note that the repository is not intended to be used to store any of the used datasets and is only intended for pulling datasets from their original sources.

Maintaining this repository by Delta E+ members by continuously adding datasets is extremely important for its success. If a researcher finds and uses a dataset for one of their projects they are expected to fill the form and add the dataset information to the Read the Docs.

The 'How to' pages are intended to be used by resarchers to figure out how to add datasets, search through datasets, and edit dataset information.

Page 1 is intended to explain the step by step guide of what a researcher should do while using this repository.

Page 2 is intended to explain how to add datasets.

Page 3 is used to explain the form questions and what's expected when filling them out.

Page 4 is used to help researchers with how to search for datasets, with an accompanied example.

Page 5 is used to explain how to edit datasets.

Page 6 is examples of how to enter form questions.
