# Overview

Welcome to Delta-E Docs! This documentation repository is designed to support the research projects of Delta E+ members. Its primary purpose is to provide a convenient way to search for and reuse previously used datasets in Delta E+ projects. By centralizing dataset information, researchers working on similar topics can easily locate and access relevant datasets.

:::{info}
This repository does not store the actual datasets used in projects. Its purpose is solely to provide information and facilitate the discovery of datasets from their original sources.
:::

The success of this repository depends on the active involvement of Delta E+ members in maintaining and continuously adding datasets. Whenever a researcher discovers and utilizes a dataset for their project, it is expected that they contribute to the repository by filling out the appropriate form and adding the dataset information to Read the Docs.

## Target user group

Delta-E is intended for researchers, planners and investigators who need a fast, easy-to-use tool for creating scripts for data sets. 

The Delta-E workflow is divided into two sub workflows to best serve our everchanging community of researchers, planners and investigators:

[Developer Workflow](UserGuide.md#developer-workflow)

A developer is a user who wants to add or modify a dataset in this repository. This requires reading the contributing guide, knowing all details of the dataset to add, and understanding the use cases of the dataset.

[Researcher Workflow](UserGuide.md#researcher-workflow)

A researcher is a user who wants to use a dataset in this repository. This includes searching for the dataset and automatically pulling the data into your scripts through installing the python package delta-e-utils .

## Dependencies

Delta-E is written and tested to be compatible with Python 3.6 and above.

## Usage flowchart
