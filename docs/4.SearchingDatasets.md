## **4. Searching for Datasets**

Researchers looking for datasets need to use the specified tag list in Page 3: Section N: [Taglist Headers](3.FormDescriptions.md#tag-list-headers). The search function on the read the doc can be used to sift through datasets and their tag lists and find datasets that you need, if they're available. The search function will only recognise words from the tags list and the region section of the form.

For example: A researcher is looking for the power output of wind turbines in Canada. The researcher would look up 'Sector:Power, Uses:Generation, Subject:Technical, Dtype:Tabular, ReCar:Wind', 'ReCar:Electricity' . This would allow the researcher to find datasets that fit these tag criteria, to find their required datasets.
