## **4. Searching for Datasets**

Researchers looking for datasets need to use the specified tag list present on **Form descriptions page: Section N:** [Taglist Headers](3.FormDescriptions.md#tag-list-headers). The search function on the read the doc can be used to sift through datasets and their tag lists and find datasets that you need, if they're available. The search function will look for any docstring in the form code, so to ensure your search is more accurate, we've created the tags list feature for more accurate searching. To look for datasets, we reccomend using the specified tags list.

For example: A researcher is looking for the power output of wind turbines in Canada. The researcher would look up `Sector:Power, Uses:Generation, Subject:Technical, Dtype:Tabular, ReCar:Wind`, `ReCar:Electricity` . This would allow the researcher to find datasets that fit these tag criteria, to find their required datasets.
