## **2. Adding Datasets**

After deciding that a dataset is useful for your research and/or could be useful for other research projects, please open the form to add the datasets by downloading the input.py found in the front page of delta-e-utils.

To do this, first you need to clone the repository on to your machine. Then create a new branch in delta-e-utils. Check the README.md on the front page of delta-e-utils on how to do this. Next, you need to install Tkinter and PIL by writing the following into your command line:

Tkinter:
```bash
pip install tk
```

PIL:
```bash
pip install pillow
```
or
```python
python -m pip install --upgrade Pillow
```

After all the above is complete, write the following into your command line to run the form UI:

```python
python3 input.py
```

Use Page 2 of this how to guide to help with filling the form. After submitting the form it will create a page in: docs/_build/html/index.html which will contain the new dataset you added above, also you will be able to see a python file in src/delta_e/project_name/projectname.py make sure to write all your code and scripting in this .py file.

Once all of this is complete you can finish adding your dataset by writing:

```python
make html
```

Now the dataset is ready to be found in Read the Doc by Delta E+ researchers!

For more complex datasets ensure to write a notebook of how to run the scripts and any additional tips and tricks required to acquire the data from the scripts.
