## **Adding Datasets**

After deciding that a dataset is useful for your research and/or could be useful for other research projects, please open the form to add the datasets by downloading the dataform executable found in the front page of delta-e-utils.

To do this, first you need to **clone the repository** on to your machine. **Then create a new branch in delta-e-utils**. Check the [contribution file](contributing.md#clone-the-repository) on the the Read the Docs on how to do clone and create a new branch.
After that is complete, Double click on dataform.exe in your cloned repository, this will run the form UI.

[Form Descriptions](3.FormDescriptions) will hep you understand what the term inside the form means.

The following pages will show step by step how to use the app:

After submitting the form it will create a page in the docs, file location in the repository: `docs/\_build/html/index.html` which will contain the new dataset you added above, you will also be able to see a python file in `src/delta_e/dataset_name/dataset_name.py` where you can write all your code and scripting in relation the dataset just added.

Once all of this is complete refer back to the [contribution file](contributing.md#implement-your-changes) and push your changes to your branch.

Now the dataset is ready to be found in Read the Doc by Delta E+ researchers!

For more complex datasets ensure to write a notebook of how to run the scripts and any additional tips and tricks required to acquire the data from the scripts.
