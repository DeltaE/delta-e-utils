## **Updating datasets**

If a dataset's information needs to be changed (such as if a new project needs to be added to the current list of projects the dataset is used for) the researcher who has become aware of the update is required to update the dataset's information on the module level docstring in the .py file.

To do this the research needs to access the .py file found on `src/delta_e/dataset_name/dataset_name.py` with the dataset name and edit the form fields that have updates.

The main example of this is if a dataset is used for a new project. The researcher will need to find the .py file and edit the project name section with the new project being used. A list of project names can be found [here](https://github.com/DeltaE/delta-e-utils/blob/main/input.yaml).
